# ðŸ©º Evaluating Diabetes Care Outcomes (NDA 2021â€“22)

This repository presents a data-driven case study evaluating diabetes care quality in England using the **National Diabetes Audit (NDA) 2021â€“22** dataset. The analysis compares **Type 1** and **Type 2** diabetes cohorts across key treatment and care process indicators, leveraging **Python-based EDA** and **interactive Power BI dashboards**.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- Type 1 patients showed significantly lower treatment target attainment (avg **32%**) vs. Type 2 (avg **36%**).
- Only **38%** of Type 1 patients received all eight care processes compared to **47%** in Type 2.
- Type 2 patients achieved **>76% combined statin prevention** and **87% secondary prevention** on average.
- Visual and statistical correlations were observed across HbA1c, BP, and cholesterol measures.
- Marked regional disparities highlight need for **targeted intervention and benchmarking**.

## ðŸ§  Tools Used

- **Python** â€“ for data wrangling, summary statistics, and correlation analysis.
- **Power BI** â€“ for dynamic dashboards comparing ICBs, organisations, and treatment indicators.
- **Pandas & Seaborn** â€“ for EDA, data cleaning, and exploratory plots.
